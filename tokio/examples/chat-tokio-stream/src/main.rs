/// coding along with Creating a Chat Server with async Rust and Tokio by Lily Mara
/// video tutorial @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2mWg91sx-o
/// description from youtube:
/* "Building a chat server is a great way to learn the Tokio library because a chat server forces 
you to think about concurrent IO, which is the core purpose of Tokio. In this video, Lily 
demonstrates how you can spawn background tasks to manage independent network streams, and 
use tokio::select! to concurrently poll tasks which require a shared state.
