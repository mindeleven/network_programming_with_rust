/// coding along with Real-Time Rust: Building WebSockets with Tokio Tungstenite by Chris Hay
/// video tutorial @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1ES0apOwUw
/// description from youtube:
/* " => in this tutorial, chris shows you how to get started with websockets using rust, tokio 
and tokio tungenstenite.   
=> we will create a new websocket client in rustlang using tokio and tokio-tungstenite, connect
it to a public server, and then be able to send and receive messages to a websocket server.
=> we will also connect up the rust websocket client to an existing ai agent network that chris 
has been creating (developed in a compeltely different technology, bun).   
=> we will then convert the application to becoming an automatic time bot on the ai agent network.
=> at the end of this video, you'll have a deep understanding on how to create web socket clients 
using rust" */
